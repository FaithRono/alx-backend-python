## Features

- **Real-time notifications** using Django Signals
- **Message edit history** tracking
- **Automatic data cleanup** when users are deleted
- **Threaded conversations** with optimized queries
- **Unread messages** filtering with custom managers
- **View-level caching** for improved performance

## Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.0+
- Django Signals
- Django ORM (with advanced query optimization)
- LocMemCache (Django's local memory caching)

Key Implementations
1. Event Listeners with Signals
Automatic notification creation on new messages (post_save)

Message edit history tracking (pre_save)

Data cleanup on user deletion (post_delete)

2. ORM Optimization
select_related() for foreign key relationships

prefetch_related() for many-to-many relationships

Custom UnreadMessagesManager for filtered queries

3. Caching Implementation
View-level caching with @cache_page decorator

60-second timeout for message list views

Local memory cache configuration

Best Practices
Signals:

Kept handlers lean and focused

Used @receiver decorator for clarity

Separated business logic from signal handlers

ORM:

Avoided N+1 query problems

Used .only() to limit field selection

Implemented custom managers for common queries

Caching:

Appropriate cache timeout settings

Sensitive data excluded from caching

Cache keys designed for proper scoping

Testing
Run the test suite with:

bash
python manage.py test messaging
Test coverage includes:

Signal handlers execution

Query optimization verification

Cache behavior validation

Edge cases in message threading
