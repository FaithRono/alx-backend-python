## Task 0 - Custom Class-Based Context Manager
**File:** `0-databaseconnection.py`

### Purpose
*Implements a basic context manager for SQLite database connections using Python's context manager protocol.*

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic resource management** - handles connection opening/closing
- **Transaction control** - automatically commits on successful exit
- **Cursor access** - provides direct cursor access for operations

### Implementation Breakdown
```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name

    def __enter__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        return self.cursor

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.conn.commit()
        self.cursor.close()
        self.conn.close()
Methods Explained:

__init__(self, db_name)

Initializes the manager with database name

Stores connection parameters for later use

__enter__(self)

Establishes connection when entering context

Creates and returns cursor object

Returns: Database cursor for operations

__exit__(self, ...)

Handles cleanup when exiting context

Commits transactions automatically

Closes cursor and connection

Note: Basic error handling through commit

Usage Example
python
with DatabaseConnection("users.db") as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(row)
Best Practices:

Always use with-statement to ensure proper cleanup

Consider adding error handling in __exit__

Can be extended with connection pooling

Task 1 - Reusable Query Context Manager
File: 1-execute.py

Purpose
Creates a specialized context manager that executes parameterized queries and returns results automatically.

Key Improvements:

Query parameterization - supports safe SQL parameters

Result handling - automatically fetches and returns results

Reusable pattern - encapsulates common query execution logic

Implementation Breakdown
python
class ExecuteQuery:
    def __init__(self, db_name, query, params=()):
        self.db_name = db_name
        self.query = query
        self.params = params

    def __enter__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        self.cursor.execute(self.query, self.params)
        return self.cursor.fetchall()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.cursor.close()
        self.conn.close()
Key Differences from Task 0:

Accepts query and parameters at initialization

Executes query automatically in __enter__

Returns results directly instead of cursor

No automatic commit (read-only by design)

Usage Example
python
with ExecuteQuery("users.db", 
                 "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?", 
                 (25,)) as results:
    for row in results:
        print(row)
Advantages:

Reduces boilerplate for common queries

Prevents SQL injection through parameterization

Cleaner interface for read operations

Limitations:

Currently read-only implementation

No transaction control for writes

Task 2 - Concurrent Async DB Queries
File: 3-concurrent.py

Purpose
Demonstrates concurrent database operations using async/await with aiosqlite.

Key Features:

Asynchronous I/O - non-blocking database operations

Concurrent execution - parallel query execution

Modern Python - uses async/await syntax

Implementation Breakdown
python
async def async_fetch_users():
    async with aiosqlite.connect("users.db") as db:
        async with db.execute("SELECT * FROM users") as cursor:
            return await cursor.fetchall()

async def fetch_concurrently():
    users, older_users = await asyncio.gather(
        async_fetch_users(),
        async_fetch_older_users()
    )
    # ... result processing ...
Components Explained:

Async Context Managers

async with for connection and cursor management

Non-blocking operations throughout

Concurrent Execution

asyncio.gather() runs queries in parallel

Efficient for I/O-bound operations

Result Processing

Structured return of multiple result sets

Maintains type safety with async returns

Usage Pattern
python
async def main():
    results = await fetch_concurrently()
    # Process results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Performance Benefits:

Reduces latency for multiple queries

Better resource utilization than threading

Scalable for many concurrent operations

Considerations:

Requires async-compatible SQLite driver

Different paradigm from synchronous code

Error handling needs special attention

Comparison Summary
Feature	Task 0 (Basic)	Task 1 (Query)	Task 2 (Async)
Connection Handling	✅ Automatic	✅ Automatic	✅ Async
Query Execution	❌ Manual	✅ Automatic	✅ Async
Parameter Support	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Concurrency	❌ No	❌ No	✅ Yes
Return Type	Cursor	Results	Async Results
Best For	Simple ops	Common queries	High throughput
Evolution Path:

Start with basic connection management

Progress to reusable query patterns

Scale with async concurrency
